Problem 1
(a) Which of the following are acceptable behaviors in solving homeworks/projects (reference the Assignments page)?
  Looking up information relevant to the course online.
  Asking the course staff for help.
  Copying test cases from my classmates or Piazza when test cases are not graded.

(b) Which of the following are recommended ways of writing code?
  emacs
  Eclipse
  sublime
  MS Visual Studio (or MS VS Code)

(c) What is the late submission policy?
  Each student has 4 late days of which only 1 can be used per HW.

(d) After making a HW submission by pushing your code to Github you should...
  Complete the homework submission form.
  Start the next assignment sooner.

Problem 2
(a) Which of the following git user interfaces are accepted and supported in this course?
  Git Bash (Windows)
  Terminal (Mac or Linux)

(b) Provide the appropriate git command to perform the following operations:
  1. Stage an untracked file to be committed. The file is called 'hw1q2b.cpp'.
    git add hw1q2b.cpp
  2. Display the details of the last three commits in the repository.
    To see commit history of the repository: use "git log"
    git log -p -3
  
(c) Let's say you staged three files to be committed. Then, you ran the following command:
  "git commit"
  What will git do?
  Git will "commit files that are staged for commit". Each commit must have a message associated with it. 
  In other words, git will commit all three files and make them part of the repository.
